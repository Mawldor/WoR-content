⚠️I did not have a ring that had regen as main, and just Healing effect/atk% as substats, so I tested with CDMG as main ⚠️

# Conclusion

Most differences are fairly marginal, and could be substantially offset by cycling ults and healing quicker.

It seems best to be at ~150ish healing effect, and then as much ATK as possible (210%+) in terms of raw healing
