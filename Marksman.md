<details>

<summary><h3>Spirit Siphon</h3></summary> 

- Incredible for single target damage (Hex, Setram, Lucius...)
- Worth maxxing at least 2 of it
- Damage %, synergizes well with IR units

</details>

<details>

<summary><h3>Sharpshooter Crest</h3></summary> 

- Solid for AoE champions (Nyx, Maul...)
- 1 should be enough for most uses/accounts.
- Damage %, synergizes well with IR units
- Situational, brings nothing if units will consistently be close to the champion

</details>

<summary><h3>Idril's Gaze</h3></summary> 

- Incredibly good for low attack marksmen who attack quickly (Hatssut, Idril...)
- Incredibly good in high defense content
- Overall a great artifact
- Worth maxxing out 1-2


</details>


## Okay

<details>

<summary><h3>Reaper's Emblem</h3></summary> 

- Solid for content where the champion will kill units consistently
- Damage %, synergizes well with IR units
- Situational. No kills means little value.
- Would only max one if arena is something you care about

</details>

<details>

<summary><h3>Bloodbond Signet</h3></summary> 

- Solid for content where little to no damage will be taken
- Damage boost is permanent, and will not fluctuate.
- I would not prioritise maxing one

</details>

## Mediocre

<summary><h3>Shadow Gaze</h3></summary> 

- ATK% boost, May be better for high defense content
- Should be well suited for fast units earlier on in the game

</details>

<details>
