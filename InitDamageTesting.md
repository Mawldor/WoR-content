# Init damage testing

I've seen some claims regarding Inits damage increase being "bugged" and the champion not working properly. Considering I use him effectively in a 149k+ apoc II team, that seemed surprising and interesting to me, so I went ahead and tested it to be sure.

## Parameters of the test

- Valk as damage dealer, using an eye of sin or a lunacy
- Init placed, with a 20% damage increase on his initial cores
- NM4
- That's it.

## Valk IR Eye of sin second hit

### Without Init

### With Init

The increase is about 20%

The increase is about 20%

## Conclusion

Init works fine, damage is increasing, nothing to see here.
