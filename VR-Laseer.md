- Damage dealers facing the middle should do most of the work. A tank can be placed in front of the nexus if need be.
- A fighter to cover bottom left lane makes the mage spawns easier to handle

## Second fight

- Two damage dealers and a tank should cover the central area. It should also cover the first mage spawn
- A marksman helps take down the mage spawns, add in two fighters and they should be limited to the side lines

- A tank and damage dealer bottom to cover the crystal should be enough, at the top a solid fighter covered by a healer can cover both mage spawns

- Drop a decimus and/or baron to tempo the shadowkeeper, rinse and repeat until dead
- Continue using decimus/baron to temporize the mages until idril ults are back up

- This one has mostly always just been throwing damage dealers to cover every area possible
- More tanks middle could help temporize if you don't have enough damage


## Laseer

- A cyrene in a tank set helps set up the map quicker
- A Maul right side can cover it, if you have better options it makes it easier. (Maul facing up)
- It's critical that the last unit placed be your tank, and that said tank is placed before the boss starts moving
- As soon as the bsos is down, recall the tank
