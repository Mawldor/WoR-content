- Damage dealers facing the middle should do most of the work. A tank can be placed in front of the nexus if need be.
- A fighter to cover bottom left lane makes the mage spawns easier to handle

- Two damage dealers and a tank should cover the central area. It should also cover the first mage spawn
- A marksman helps take down the mage spawns, add in two fighters and they should be limited to the side lines
