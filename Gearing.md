# Gearing in general

Depending on what content you're planning on tackling, and barring some exceptions (Silas, always silas), there are some gearing concepts that will change. 

I'll try to go over them in as much detail as I can, when to use them, and how to set them up

# Gear plans

First and foremost, **take the time to set up, and maintain, your list of gear plans**. These make everything easier. Setup plans for each category of content separately, and finish making the plans for that one, before starting to build for another.

The screenshot above is a decently good example. Depending on the type of content I'm doing, there are different gear plans that I use. And I break and re-use build from other sections of the game, for the one I'm currently running.

So, if I gear my champions for GB2 for example, chances are, any builds used for GvG or GB are now broken, and split up across multiple champions. 

Which brings us to the second point


# Types of content to gear for

There are two main types of gear plans you want going, for your champions in general.

## DPS champions 


The general order of priority when gearing for a dps is Atk (or main stat) > Crit > Speed > Crit damage > Regen

### General PVE

By far the easiest to gear for. This includes things like campaign, gear raids, gear dungeons, faction trials, guild boss 1 & 2, etc...

The general flow and logic is about as follows :

- **180-200% ATK** (Or whatever main stat that dps is using)
  - The previously listed content is generally fairly low on defense, so pushing ATK too high serves no purpose.
- **As close to 100%** crit rate as you can get
  - Capping crit is self explanatory
- **300+** attack speed
  - You want speed to generate ults more often, and hit more often, but this has diminishing returns
- As much crit damage as you can get after that
  - This is then where you gain the most damage
- Rage regen if you can
  - Helps with more frequent ulting


I'll be using hex as an example between content types, see the below screenshot.

Generally speaking, this means 2 ATK% main right side pieces, and one CDMG one. 

### High defense content

A bit more complicated to gear for, and a lot more gear hungry. This is content like High gear raid 1, Arena, GvG...

The priority order still remains, but there is no longer any reason to put a cap on ATK.

- **As much ATK as you can fit on your build**
  - Most of this content has High defense mobs, meaning if your attack is too low, you will hit like a wet noodle. You want **ALL** the ATK
The rest is exactly the same order of priority as general PVE

## Tanks

There aren't really many subtleties on tank gearing. You have two main categories of tanks. 
- Ones that use their ults often, and it serves a purpose (Brokkir, Baron, Torodor, etc...)
- Ones that do not (Really mainly Olague and the shitty dwarves)

## Tanks that use ults

Stat priority should be as follows :

HP% > DEF% > Speed > Rage Regen > HP > DEF

### Tanks that don't use ults
HP% > DEF% > HP > DEF

### Weird semi DPS tanks
Get a Glacier set with HP% mains, DEF% and ATK% subs, and speed or crit if you can get it in there


### Good right side sets

- Tempered Will
- Unshaken Will
- Guardian
- Invigoration
- Morale
- Any T2+ set
- Glacier
- Asclepius

## Crowd control champions

This is mainly for champions like Theowin/Greed/Marri, who have low damage due to their stats, so it's generally best to focus building them with faster attacks and ult cycling

### If you need some damage nonetheless

(Marri will never do damage anyways, don't even bother)

Speed > Rage Regen > ATK% > Crit rate > CDMG

### If you've accepted that their damage will be trash

Speed > Rage Regen > HP% > HP

### Good right side sets

- Mana spring
- Invigoration
- Morale
- Guardian/Tempered will


## Healers

After some testing, the overall priority seems to be about as follows

- ~150 Healing effect
  - Going much over this seems to have dimishing returns, and it would be better to push for more ATK/Speed/Regen instead
- **210%+ of the main stat**
- **As much attack speed as possible**
- **As much rage regen as possible**
- HP for content where the healer will take damage
