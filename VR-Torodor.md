## First crimson guard fight

- Setup with a tank/healer and some magic damage on bottom left of the map
- Setup a row of marksmen top left, to handle the crimson guard spawns

- You will want to save your marksmen ults for the second series of spawns of crimson guards, as quite a bit will spawn.
- Once that wave has been handled, recall the marksmen, and swap them to the right side as soon as you can.

- Same logic, save ults for second wave


## Second crimson guard fight
- Start by setting up the tank at top, a single target magic damage dealer facing left, and a physical marksman facing down
- Place tank bottom to block the mages

- Place healer top right
- Place healer bottom right
- Place marksman bottom left to handle crimson guard spawns

- This leaves you with a few options for the last unit, either block incoming healers with a tank, or throw in more damage to take care of them

## Crimson star
- Setup a marksman top facing up to take out the healers
- Setup marri on the center platform facing right
- Setup a single target magic DPS next to marri, facing up, to maximize damage time out of range of healers

- Setup two single target DPS bottom platform, a tank, and then a healer (Liam is an excellent option here if you don't have some of the top shelf units)

- Let crimson star just kill your marksman, you will replace them when you can
- Once you've handled the second wave of destroyer/healers and crimson star, remove all of your champions, and wait for respawn timers
- Set everyone up to cover the top part, and handle the incoming waves of destroyer/healers.

# Phase 3

## Slaughter

- Setup a tank top right, healer bottom platform facing up, and a damage dealer facing up

![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/9507a958-fc0c-4b53-a075-7bd0d7dd77d2)

- Setup a second tank bottom right, and put a fighter facing in on each side

- That's it


## Baron

- Setup a tanky fighter (Abom works quite well here) for the top lane, a fighter for the lane under that, and a healer to keep abom alive

- Setup a fighter bottom lane, your main platform damage dealer (You could do a healer here instead, if you have a strong ranged fighter like arrogance for the second lane from top, just face him down so he hits the boss)
- Either use Valeriya, aatrox, or a ranged fighter as supplemental boss damage

- Have a second tank ready for some rotations where Olague might get killed


## Torodor

- For the bottom left, using abom/volk/any ranged fighter with at least 2 cell reach and decent damage should work if you face them up, a tank and a healer to make sure nothing dies

- For top right, one single target damage dealer facing left (Khamet, Silas, Hex, Praetus, Mycah... Quite a few options would work). One fighter to intercept top lane spawns, and a tank to block torodor.

- Once Torodor did his first hit, drop 2 fighters on him to ensure he goes down quick, then recall all three

- Repeat the same process for Torodors phase 2 at the top
