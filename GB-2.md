# General Overview

GB2 has three distinct phases, which each have their own specifics that need to be dealt with. When building your team, you will want to consider all of them. 

**First phase** -> You need to have some crowd control, in the form of stuns/freezes/knock ups (christ they need to find a better name for this), to be used when he is casting his sawblade. This will reduce his attack. 

**Second phase** -> **Pure. Unadulterated. Damage.** You need to burst him down as fast as possible, as early as possible, or he will build up too much % resistance.

**Third phase** -> Cleansing. Which, honestly, is terrible, considering there are only like 3 champions that can actually help for this phase. 

He will then loop back to the first phase, gain some stats, and everything will start again. As it progresses, his attacks/buffs/debuffs become stronger and more plentiful as well.

**Top chest of first difficulty is less valuable than bottom chest of second** so keep this in mind when making your teams


**I will not be listing every champion that could possibly work. I will list the more intesting ones. I will also only list each champion once, even if they fill multiple roles.**

<summary><h1>Gearing</h1></summary> 

**Turns out I was wrong, you seem to be able to get away with one CDMG piece with roughly the same numbers. Some report better results with one piece CDMG**

~~Besides a select few champions (like Silas) **You NEED to get as much ATK as possible on your champions**. The boss has high defense, you will do little to no damage if you do not properly gear your team.~~

~~Stat priority should be roughly as follows for damage dealers~~

~~ATK > Crit rate > Speed > Crit damage > Rage regen~~

I ran some testing after Ledz mentionned better results with one CDMG piece, and holding ults. 

I did two different gearing options, and two different ways to fight the boss. I went up to the start of phase 1 at 3 stacks each time.

Spam ults -> Self explanatory. If an ult is up, it's used, unless it's being held for phase 1.

Hold ults -> Use the strict minimum ults to take the boss down within the time limit, hold as many as possible to be sure they're available for the vulnerability phase.

What I did exactly was the following 

- Use mainly Praetus/TF/Ferssi in between vulne phases
- Hold constance and long cycling ults during 0-1 stacks
- Same for saw & poison on 2 stacks
- For shield on 2 stacks, one global round of ults, start holding near 30%

One thing to note, I started the first test with Alistair using a skull, not ToT. Which meant I needed to do them all or repeat the tries I already did. I was lazy.

## TL;DR

- One CDMG seems comparable to full ATK. Possibly better, but it ended up equal for me
- Holding ults as much as possible gave me a 13% increase in fragments
- Credit goes to Ledz for the idea

<summary><h1>Overall good roster picks</h1></summary> 

<details>

<summary><h2>Damage reduction</h2></summary> 

This guys hurts. **A lot.** As much as possible, you are always going to want two things going at all times.

- Damage reduction (Buff on your champions)
- Damage reduction (Debuff on the boss)

### Volka
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/7b68dbf9-237e-406e-a999-175383ba5bad)

Easiest to obtain option, since she's part of the storyline rewards. She brings a few interesting options to the table

![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/dc3a1622-d307-4209-9b92-001e166e325d)

- Her above skill, which will reduce the damage the boss does. Her uptime will not be 100% however, which could land you in a situation where it's not up for a big AoE. Her exclusive will help massively with this.
- Her ult will apply both vulnerabilities, which will greatly help taking down the boss faster.

### Alistair
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/274da279-c2be-4242-9bbb-1ed03b09a5b5)

Was a fusion, and is quite possibly the MVP of this entire fight, regardless of phase/difficulty.

![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/88273158-2334-48ea-b082-06afc20f8950)

- The above passive is simply bonkers. It **will** permanently be up. 30% constant damage reduction debuff.
- He's an arbiter, so he will deal true damage, and radiant erosion, which deals true damage based on the targets defense. And guess what, this boss is stacked to the gills with defense.
- He boosts his own ATK during ult, further enhancing his damage through the high defense of the boss.

### Ferssi
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/f58f2cce-5219-46ae-b2c2-7182ee59cecb)

Is a great champion for this, because he fills in 3 roles

- Damage reduction buff on all allies in range
- Healer
- Inspiration to allies

### Sadie
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/bf812b50-5d44-4996-9e33-6ef0b3ca0c71)

Is a great option for damage reduction, since on top of her passive, her ult will further reduce damage taken, possibly saving from a nasty hit here and there

### Aylin
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/78e5197d-2a15-41d0-90c9-9aca32f32b30)

Is a good option, has a passive damage reduction to allies in range, and will also dish out some serious healing


</details>

<details>

<summary><h2>Palm strike</h2></summary> 

The palm strike has two parts to it, an AoE component, which will deal damage to all of your champions, and a single target component, which **will target your highest HP champion**. For this reason, I would highly recommend bringing a tank to the party. 
Ideally, you have your tank in a morale/invigoration set, so they enhance your damage dealer(s) while they're at it

### Torodor
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/80770e17-f37a-4365-9b08-67f8f62b34a4)

An absolutely fantastic unit for this boss. He brings a lot to the table

- Def reduction on the boss
- Stuns for phase 1
- Is a lord for one of the best factions
- Can revive once

### Constance
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/5dad3a3f-f4ec-4481-9890-470a6303c6f5)

Another tank that brings a lot to the table. Inspiration is invaluable in this fight.

- Brings more heals
- Brings inspiration
- Is an arbiter


### Reve
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/0bc081c4-55bf-4dae-a120-a10242070694)

Is a very good option overall, mainly for phase 1. His ult will handle the saw casts quite nicely

### Azhor (yeah, this shitter)
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/5aedafb7-2f48-4230-889f-c643ca4baada)

Azhor is surprisingly a good option for once. He's a bit hard to keep alive in the later stages of the fight, since he's a genuinely terrible tank, but if you flat out ignore his ult, he does pretty solid work on phase 1, especially in a NM team if you don't have torodor.

### The better dwarf (Brokkir)
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/87fe7691-0061-4c87-8317-300855fd39b0)

Brokkir is not all that great for this boss overall, but he does make it easier for adjacent allies to survive, with his passive, so he remains a decent option.

### The epics
Baron/Livian/Olague... They're tanks. They'll survive. They probably won't bring much else to the table, but they're options if you have none of the above.

Livian specifically, has a stun, and integrated damage reduction, so she is a little above the rest in terms of value.

<details>

<summary><h1>Phase 1</h1></summary> 

You will need to plan for some units in your team to deal with this phase. One dedicated unit might be enough depending on the unit, but a lot of champions have incidental stuns, that can also help alleviate how much of a dedicated champion you need here.

For some, like Reve, Torodor, Twinfiend, Nazeen, you want to make absolutely sure your ultimates are up when the boss starts casting his skills.

The general idea, is that when he starts casting his sawblade attack, each stun/freeze/knock up (I swear to god, the naming), will reduce the charge, and reduce the boss's attack, making the inevitable attack deal less damage.

## Champions

### Helga
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/698de4f6-adf1-4d4a-8404-93c94bddaf54)

Best girl for GB2 phase 1. In a decent build, she should output 7 stuns on her own, and still do some reasonable damage. By far the best pick if your teams are fairly platform heavy, as mine tend to be.

### Twinfiend
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/037e1dc0-22c2-41dc-bbc9-2e922ca1c4f8)

A great lord for a great faction, his ult comes back quickly, and if you time it correctly and don't get too eager with it, he will be able to ult for each sawblade cast, generally adding a few stacks of ATK reduction to the boss.

### Setram
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/db764e00-577e-4a1c-8d9d-8902774536b5)

He has a chance to proc an attack with a stun. This will not be reliable, and won't work during ults, but it helps somewhat

### Hex
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/12b2f905-ea40-43a4-afac-214e4e2e4710)

Much like Setram, he can sometimes proc a stun, which helps on this phase. 

### Aracha 
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/acec9d4b-0e26-4d74-9459-75995fa149ea)

Is another great option, will proc stuns on the passive, and is a lord for another of the good factions on this boss.

### Nazeem
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/b03d8914-050d-49c8-b813-b14cf242453a)

Is an option. With 1k2 cost for his ult, and middling damage, his sole purpose would be helping on phase 1. But it's an option if that is where you are dying. 


### Uredin
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/3a5ac366-b798-4c73-bcff-8f4b95b28880)

Has stuns on his ult, not sure how good his overall damage is

### Ajax
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/e55024d6-88f8-482e-9805-cfd231ee6855)

His damage won't be great, but he fits in any faction, gives a damage boost to everyone, and dishes out some stuns

### Abomination
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/163f16a0-03c8-4138-8d2b-9a1727a504bf)

Does some incidental stuns if you have him A1, and is easy to keep alive, as well as doing reasonable damage. Not the best unit, but does serve some purpose.


## General strategy and tips

- Make sure you hold off on using (or not using in the case of, say, Azhor) ults to have them ready for the saw phases
- You can make use of incidental/small stun count champions (Torodor/Praetus ability at 2+ stacks/Aracha...) to give some more time to your main stun champion (Helga, Nazeem, etc...) to get their ult back
- It is sometimes very much worth it to sacrfice damage, in favor of speed/regen, just for your stun champion to be more efficient at controlling this phase
- You want to, at the very least, reach a solid 7+ stacks on this phase when you want to push fairly high up, and that's with a Ferssi.

<summary><h1>Phase 2</h1></summary> 
Phase 2 is just a pure damage burstdown. You want to kill this phase as fast as possible. Hold your ults, and pop them as soon as you can once this phase starts

I won't go into in depth champions here, as it's pretty much the usual cast.

The boss has a fixed cycle for his abilities, that goes as follows :

- Earth shatter
- Aegis
- Palm strike
- Aegis

It takes him roughly 43 seconds to cycle between the start of an earth shatter, to the next

### Silas
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/92842b4d-ff54-4745-bd21-2904fe9e6b4e)

Silas, as usual, does his silas things, and ignores defense, providing massive damage. Nothing new here

### Hex
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/28ebb941-d4c4-4471-8620-fb9a3df29489)

Hex, doing hex things, also brings some pretty solid damage.

### Arrogance
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/fac3136c-805c-4d70-8a92-8ada71070f8c)

Arrogance is definitely one of the better options, especially since he fits nicely in the NM teams.

### Praetus
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/bbcc475e-3204-4173-964c-62190f2c2626)

Do I really need to say much? 

- Lord for best faction for this boss
- True damage
- A lot of damage
- Busted lord ability

I mean, it's Prae Prae

### Elddr
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/d7ae2cc1-f519-46bf-8872-28accf6585be)

Seems to be able to dish out an impressive amount of damage from what I've seen on some guildmates. Definitely a solid option.

### Falcia

I'm not sure what numbers she is truly pulling, but she does do true damage, which helps for phase 2, if nothing else.

### Nocturne

True damage, infernal, solid.


### Kalina
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/4935e180-21dc-466f-b3c9-ea2062167692)

A true damage epic, probably a very good budget option

## General strategy and tips

- Holding all of your ults at the end of phase 1, until Semrah stands up at the start of phase 2, will make the phase much easier to pass
- Vulnerabilities, decrease defense, increased damage taken, bleed, invigoration, inspiration, morale... all of these will eke out a little more damage, and help here, sometimes even if the champion applying them is doing little damage themselves
- Lucius can be of help here

</details>



<details>

<summary><h1>Phase 3</h1></summary> 
Phase 3 is where a lot of people will (justly) want to throw shit. You need to be able to cleanse the poisons. 

But wait, what cleansing options do we actually have?

## Champions

### Elowyn
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/fc55797c-e23d-444f-8643-1b4549965b03)

I still can't get over the absolutely terrible redesign of her picture, but hey. She's god tier.

- Rage regen
- Cleanse
- Short ult timer
- Multiple heals

### Dassomi
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/97fee0df-ccfe-4a49-a2a9-266060315f0d)

Will do decent cleansing if you can keep everyone topped up in life. Not sure how well he works on his own.

### Eunomia
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/5743aa89-ed30-433f-9945-3cf2811975b3)

Utter rubbish, but she does have some cleansing (3 champs every 30 seconds, fucks sake)

### Midan
![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/927940c3-e849-4784-be6d-e7bdf1eabfa2)

Can get the job done, but she will need some serious rage regen, and a supporting regen character. And this is the second best option. It's a joke that we're stuck with such a reduced cast for an entire phase.

## General strategy and tips

- Hold the first cleanse until after his first **CAST**, do not cleanse immediately as the phase starts
- Save any other healing ultimates until during the hit he does after applying the first poison stack in between cleanses. This helps immensely
- Abuse Elowyns wood elf, one less champion to heal for your healers means better survival for everyone
