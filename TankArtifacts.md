<summary><h3>Bastion Ring</h3></summary> 

- Damage reduction
- More block

<summary><h3>Astral Obelisk</h3></summary> 

- Rage regen is the main selling point here

<summary><h3>Goddesss' Grace</h3></summary> 

- Stacking def bonus

<summary><h3>Soulbane Rosary</h3></summary> 

- ATK % & Speed boost
- Arguably the best one if you're going for damage on non def units, pity it's a legendary.

</details>

<summary><h3>Regal crest</h3></summary>
