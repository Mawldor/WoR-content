## Preface

GR3 is probably the one that took me the most time, effort, and tryharding, but it is also the one of the three with the most options to tackle it. 

I spent **days** spread out over multiple weeks, coming back to and attempting it again. With slightly different gear, champs, placements. 

The point I'm trying to make, is that barring having just the right champs, this is the one that can actually be fine tuned with what you have available. So on this one specifically, I would recommend genuinely wracking your brain, and repeatedly making small incremental changes

I'll do what I can to provide insight on what options exist.

## The layout, and the sections - 19-20-21

GR3 is essentially 3 different parts to handle. 

Left side, arguably the easiest, just requires one AoE marksman. 

Middle, more complicated to handle, but with options, will require at least two good marksmen, possibly more, and possibly some tank/fighter options.

Left side, the worst one. The real problem with left side, is that you will really need good gear, or the right champions for it. And without the right champions it will be a struggle.

## Tactics

### Left side

Fairly straightforward, really just need one AoE marskman to handle it. 

#### Champion options

- Maul
- Nyx
- Razaak
- Kai (ew)

You may be able to use some others, but those are the ones I'm mostly sure of

### Middle

This one is going to be a rough one. Because a bunch of options **can** work. 

So first, we're going to talk about my personal dream team

#### Idril

Idril is nuts. She is the single most versatile unit for GR3. No contest. (Except of course if you pulled Aracha, Silas, Alaura and company, but then why are you even reading this guide, gr3-21 should already be completed for you) She can handle middle and right side thanks to ult, and overall is the most F2P friendly way of doing this. 
**IF** you go for an Idril team, you want to lean into her passive

This carries. So if you're running champs who ult often, that's a lot of clutch damage. And you want to really pay attention to **when** you use those ults. Do you need them to clear out a summon wave? Do you need them to clear out a side mob? Is it important to try to burst the boss down?

#### Liam

Yeah, this guy here

![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/1b24c0c1-96d3-474f-85b4-d0e459bfa0a1)

Liam is a chad. And silas can go get bent. (This point of view is biased, if you have a bonded silas, congrats, that does a good part of your GR3 right there)

Liam is great, **when used with idril** for three main reasons :

- Short ult, buffing idril
- Requires virtually no investment besides speed and rage regen gear, mana spring set if you can is even better (I used him two stars)
- Does poison on the boss, dishing out reasonable single target damage

#### Silas

I don't have him, I don't like him. But only because I don't have him. If you have a bonded silas, maybe even an unbonded to be fair, he just wrecks the boss, and then you're much more free on options to handle all the rest. 

Just drop him down, with some good Infernal Roar and a crit damage build, and he'll probably carry your GR3.

#### Calypso

May be an option? Will never be the main damage dealer, but could help when paired with idril. Could also possibly help when placed later on to finish boss quicker and free up idril for sides

#### Setram

Can help on 19-20 on front tiles, for 21 the cost gets oppressive, and I feel he is best used placed later on, behind your actual front tile units, to finish the boss quicker.

#### Razaak/Nyx/Kai

Can provide some assistance when placed later during the fight, to get the boss and adds under control quicker.

#### Iovar

Will probably work, same issue, do not have him, but I would expect him to do great work as a front tile unit.

#### Brienne

Can work on 19-20, I'm not sure about 21, having never managed to make her work myself.

#### Esme

Can work on 19-20-21, does pretty solid work with the bounces and poison.

#### Arrogance

Works great if placed up front to get the boss and adds down quicker

#### Apsan

Probably one of the rare places he's actually useful. Helps if placed later in the fight to burst down boss.

#### Aracha

Presumably useful to help add some more damage to the fight, again, don't have her, not sure if she actually serves a purpose once placed. 


#### Supporting cast

Regardless of who you use, you're going to want some units to buff your main damage dealers. 

These are the usual :

- Dolores, to boost ATK and burst down packs/boss
- Hollow, for rage regen
- Elowyn, for rage regen
- Laurel, placed and then picked up, again, for rage regen


### Right side

The right side is a singularly annoying one. If you do not have Alaura or hatssut, very few can actually fill in this role.

#### Hatsutt

Does the job well, requires some timing to make sure her invisibility is up when the side mob spawns, otherwise she will die

#### Alaura

Just needs gear, and then she fires away. I do not have her, so I'm not sure how performant she actually is, but as far as I know she does put in work.

#### Maul/Razaak

This is a bit particular. I'm assuming Razaak might work as well for this.

The idea is fairly simple, they need to be placed in the middle area, **facing right**

As the waves come in towards the crystal on the right side, you want to time their ult to take out the entire pack in one hit. This will require dolores ult being up. And despite having good gear, I have never managed to make this work for 21. Maybe with a stronger lord for either this becomes possible

Something like the below screenshot. Ignore the rest of the map, this was a run just to demonstrate the timing and concept.

#### Any number of ranged champs

![image](https://github.com/Mawldor/WoR-content/assets/173509892/cfecf9cd-342b-4937-bb59-78cccf2884ab)

You can do something like this as well. If your center area is strong enough, you can cycle between ranged units to take out this top right wave before they start moving. You still need a way to handle the right lone squid that spawns, as any unit here that is not invisible will get killed, but it's an option.

- TF
- Any of the AoE Marskmen
- Setram
- Marri might be able to tempo a bit longer until Idril gets her ult up
- Theowin/Boreas might be able to tempo and do some damage at the same time



## General gearing

Most of your champs will follow the same gearing idea. Stats > sets, but eventually, especially for 21, you will need good sets as well.

This gear raid is not defense intensive, as such, Silas being an exception, you want to aim for one crit damage main piece, and 2 ATK% main pieces. You will want to be crit capped. See my general gearing tips section of the github for more on this.
